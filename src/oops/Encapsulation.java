public class Encapsulation {
/*
 * 
 * binding data and methods together to provide more security
 * (not randomly accessible by other code outside class)
 * Data hiding - private modifier enables hiding from other classes
 * Abstraction - accessing private variables through methods
 * How encapsulation is achieved?
 * - always make data variables private
 * - methods made public so that private variables can be accessed
 * thru these methods
 * - setter and getter methods to access private variables
 * 
 * Inheritance
 * one object acquires properties of others
 * relation between subclass and superclass
 * subclass IS A relation with superclass
 * keyword - extends
 * bottom to top approach - child can only inherit the properties of parent not vice versa
 * object to be created of child only to access methods and properties of parent class
 * 
 * 
 * Types of inheritance
 * single, multiple, multilevel, hybrid, hierarchical
 *  \
 *  
 *  inheritance applied at class or interface level
 *  class - class, interfaace - interface => extends
 *  class - interface => implements
 *  
 *  class level  
 *  single, hierarchical, multilevel
 *  Mulitple - not possible in JAVA => both parents might have same method
 *  then JVM will be confused as to which parents method to call, ambiguity
 *  
 *  
 *  interface level
 *  single, hierarchical, multilevel and multiple
 *
