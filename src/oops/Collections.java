	 * Framework/API with lots of interfaces and classes
	 * Prior to collections we had

	 * 
	 * Advantages of collections
	 * 1. size is infinite (dynamic)
	 * 2. can contain mulitple data types
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Interfaces in Collections -> Map, Set, List, Queue and Utilities
	 * Each of the above interface has classes that inherits these interfaces
	 * Map - HashMap, Hashtable, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap
	 * Set - HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
	 * List - ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList
	 * Queue - PriorityQueue
	 * Utilities - Collections, Array
